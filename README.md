end

class Pet < EasyRecord
  attr_accessor :name, :color, :person_id

  belongs_to :owner, { class_name: 'Person' }, :person_id

pet.toys # => Array of toys

toy.owner.owner # => person
```

ClassName.save_to_csv # Will save all tracked instances
ClassName.load_from_csv # Will load and track all rows in csv (CSV has headers)

instance.save # Not working yet
